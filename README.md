DESCRIPTION:Task 2 of the internship focuses on implementing a deep learning model to solve a real-world problem in either Image Classification or Natural Language Processing (NLP). This task aims to strengthen your understanding of deep learning principles, hands-on experience with frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, and the ability to create a complete and functional AI model that can generate and interpret insights from raw data.

In image classification, the goal is to teach a model to recognize patterns and features within image data and assign correct labels or categories to them. Common datasets include MNIST, CIFAR-10, or Fashion-MNIST, which are widely used in training convolutional neural networks (CNNs). For instance, the model might learn to classify images of animals, vehicles, clothing, or handwritten digits. If you choose this route, you'll need to work on image preprocessing, model building (using CNN layers), compiling, training, and evaluating the model. You will also visualize the model’s performance using tools like matplotlib to display accuracy/loss curves and a confusion matrix.

If you opt for Natural Language Processing, your task may include training a model to perform sentiment analysis, text classification, or even language translation. Datasets like IMDb reviews, Twitter sentiment data, or news topic classification can be used. In this case, you'll use techniques such as tokenization, embedding layers (like Word2Vec or GloVe), and recurrent layers (LSTM/GRU). Your pipeline should include text cleaning, tokenizing the input, padding sequences, and training a deep learning model with appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Regardless of which domain you choose (image or text), the project must use either TensorFlow or PyTorch—both are powerful, open-source deep learning libraries widely adopted in industry and academia. TensorFlow offers easy model-building with Keras, and PyTorch provides flexibility with dynamic computation graphs.

Your deliverable should be a functional Python script or Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the full model-building process. Additionally, include visualizations such as learning curves (loss/accuracy vs. epochs), sample predictions, or performance metrics to explain how well your model performs. These visuals are essential to assess model effectiveness and are an integral part of your submission.

You are encouraged to explore online tutorials, courses, YouTube videos, and platforms like Kaggle to support your implementation. Store your code and files in a GitHub repository with proper documentation and comments to make your work readable and presentable.
